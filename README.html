  Hi Elizabeth:

  * Enabled loading order details to receipt template.

  * To verify Receipt.html layout, just click "部屬" >> "新增部屬作業" >> "選取類型" : "網頁應用程式" >> "部屬" and then enter the link to see in new page.
    This way you don't have to waste an email quota everytime you wanna debug on it.

  * To enable you as the email sender, click "觸發條件" >> "新增觸發條件" >> "選擇您要執行的功能" : "onSubmit"; "選取活動來源" : "試算表"; 
    "選取活動類型" : "提交表單時" >> "儲存" to set your acoount as trigger event handler.

  Hi Elizabeth:

  * The reason why your previous script doesn't work is that it links to your form, not your spreadsheet, hence it receives differet 
    format of trigger output. You are supposed to OPEN THE SCRIPT FROM THE SPREADSHEET, NOT FROM THE FORM. 
    See more info: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43429161/how-to-get-form-values-in-the-submit-event-handler/43433069#comment120256207_43433069

  * Your DAILY EMAIL QUOTA (i.e. maximum number allowed to send per day) IS LIMITED. I believe it's 100 per day as a free account.
    Therefore, you need to consdier how many customers to handle per day, if approach to 100/day or more, you need to upgrade to 
    business account.
    See more info: https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/services/quotas

  * You may want to use "取得預先填入的連結" from your form to set up default purchase number to 0, so that customers don't have to 
    set every item to 0 when they don't wanna buy it. 

  * Now the code is supposed to work and send email to orderers. I will take time to implement remaining functions when convenient. Have fun
    and give me feedbacks if any.
